Spaceship is fueled and we are ready to blast off to mars
We are docked in Spacestation, waiting for slingshot to mars
We are approaching mars, ready to land
We have landed successfully on mars, it is strangely orange
The rover is going crazy om mars
Rover is copping soil from the planet
One more thing to say!
